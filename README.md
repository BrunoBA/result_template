# result_template

# Rules
- This is just a concept how to show the user's choice
- It's not mandatory to use this structure
- This will be a **PDF RESULT** and ~~not the frontend application~~
- Some CSS/HTML tags coult not works well after export to PDF
- Let's try to economize PDF's page (maybe changing the font-size can help us)
- Search for other Oscar's list to inspirate you
- The QR code could be on bottom (If is to hard to keep this QRcode we can remove him)
- If you want to keep the QR code remember to fix his size 
- Try to focus the user's choice (The idea is make easy to know what was my bet)
- **This is just a concept, after we will build it on the application**
- The property max-width also can help us with long names
- This is the same information of backend provides you with the exatcly same size and quantity of data
- COMMIT TO THIS REPOSITORY THE HTML (files sent by Whatssap, dropbox or way to storage will be not acceptable)  
- Be free to create your file (:

-
- It's possible but we'll not use HTML + PHP for the same file. We'll split it in different little pieces with different 
responsabilities.
- At the PHP application we'll transform this index.html it in a [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/) template egine (perhaps the most important in the PHP world).
